# Tutorial for scRNA-seq data analysis beginners using R
This tutorial includes three different parts:
1. The most basic and routine analysis on one scRNA-seq data set using `Seurat` in R;
2. Data integration or batch effect correction for joint analysis of multiple scRNA-seq data sets;
3. Cell type annotation label transfer given the reference data set;
4. Brief introduction of more advanced analysis, including velocity analysis and ligand-receptor-pairing-based cell-cell communication analysis.
